## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Carnit/UT_AI_training.git>
cd projects/langchain_project
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
# or 
uv venv

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
uv sync
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

You need a Google API key to use the Gemini model.

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory.
2. Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## How to Run

Once the setup is complete, you can run the script from your terminal:
